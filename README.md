I'm excited to share a recent project I developed as part of my cybersecurity internship at Prodigy InfoTech. This project involved implementing a classic Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption tool using Python. 🛡️🔐

Here are some key features of the tool:
🔹 Encryption and Decryption: The tool allows users to encrypt or decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher method. By shifting each letter of the text by a specified number of positions, the tool transforms the original message into a coded format and vice versa.

🔹 User Interaction: The program interacts with users through the console, asking them to choose whether they want to encrypt or decrypt a message, then prompting them to input the text and the shift value.

🔹 Case Sensitivity: The tool preserves the case of the letters in the original text. Uppercase and lowercase letters are shifted within their respective ranges, ensuring accurate encryption and decryption.

🔹 Handling Non-Alphabetic Characters: The tool intelligently processes non-alphabetic characters by leaving them unchanged, making it robust and practical for various input texts.

🔹 Modular Design: The code is designed with modularity in mind, with separate functions for encryption (caesar_encrypt) and decryption (caesar_decrypt), facilitating easy maintenance and future enhancements.

🔹 Practical Application: This project provides a fundamental understanding of cryptographic principles and demonstrates the practical application of Python for solving real-world problems.
